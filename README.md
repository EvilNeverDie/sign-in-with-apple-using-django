# Sign In with Apple using Python Django
_An implementation with Python Django + Python Social Auth and iOS._

## What this document will cover

Like many developers providing third party login in their apps, we at Truffls had to implement Sign In with Apple as per their regulations. Since we (at the time of this article) already offer a number of login options like Xing, LinkedIn, Google, and Facebook we wanted to integrate Sign In with Apple in our server-side verification framework: Python Social Auth. We divided the document in three parts:

1. [Configure Identifiers and Keys](identifiers-and-keys.md)
2. [Implement Sign In with Apple in your backend](backend.md)
3. [Implement Sign In with Apple in your iOS app](iOS.md)
